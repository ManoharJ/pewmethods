# pewmethods

An R package developed by the Pew Research Center Methods team for working with survey data.

## About this package

The Methods team at Pew Research Center is proud to announce the release of version 1.0 of **pewmethods**, an R package containing various functions that we use in our day-to-day work with survey data. The package was envisioned as a way to reuse and maintain code and share it internally with other researchers around the Center. But since many of the problems that these functions were designed to solve are not unique to Pew Research Center projects, we are making the pewmethods package publicly available for other researchers who might find it useful, too. 

Survey data is a bit different from other kinds of data in that it frequently needs to be weighted to represent a larger population. The pewmethods package can help you go through the steps for creating basic survey weights, as well as display weighted estimates of categorical variables, not to mention the various cleaning, recoding, combining and collapsing tasks in between. In this way, our package complements the excellent **survey** package as well as the **tidyverse** set of R packages, which are great for data manipulation.

An overview of what's in the **pewmethods** package and how it works, along with example applications, can be found by calling ```vignette("pewmethods")``` after installation.  

## Requirements 

R 3.5 or greater

## Instructions

1. Install and load the **devtools** package.

2. Install **pewmethods** via:  

```install_github("pewresearch/pewmethods", build_vignettes = TRUE)```

Vignettes require the **rmarkdown** and **tidyverse** packages. You can install the package without vignettes by setting build_vignettes to FALSE.
